						EcoOpera Systems is providing the data acquisition and analytics for CES Engineering’s Monitoring-Based Commissioning (MBCx) process on several high performance LEED buildings.  MBCx is a holistic and comprehensive optimization process that combines strategies from Commissioning, Measurement and Verification, and Energy Engineering to identify and implement optimal building operations for maximum energy performance and occupant satisfaction.  Using site-installed data acquisition systems (DAS), EcoCEO is monitoring hundreds of data points per building (including numerous energy sub-meters) and producing building and mechanical systems performance metrics that streamline the commissioning process.  Analyzing buildings at this level of detail allows for the identification of truly optimal operations performance.<br>
