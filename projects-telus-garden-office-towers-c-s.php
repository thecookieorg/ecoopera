					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This project involves the construction of a new 22 level commercial office tower with three main zones: South, North and BAR including retail space on the ground floor with a total FSR area of 459,537 ft2 on a 40,825 ft2 site.  The site is located at West Georgia St. in Vancouver, BC.
					</p><br>
					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Gold project is tasked to provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting (Energy Management Information System - EMIS), as well as verifying energy savings and performance. CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the M&V goals, plans and process for LEED EA Credit 5.1 and 5.2, as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&V components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and owner’s goals.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The M&amp;V plan has been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2006 International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are:  heat source from nearby Telus building, high efficiency VRF controlled chillers, 100% outdoor air via heat recovery ventilators, solar PV and hot water collectors, free cooling via central cooling tower, rainwater harvesting for toilets and irrigation, CO2 demand controlled ventilation, building-wide BAS, low-flow water fixtures, raised floor displacement air ventilation system, CES M&V integration with all electrical, mechanical and control systems with instantaneous realtime data, and etc. The M&V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems among other measurement points:
					<ul>
							<li>Total Space Heating Energy</li>
							<li>Total Space Mechanical Cooling Energy</li>
							<li>Pump and Fan Energy</li>
							<li>Renewable (Photovoltaic) Electrical Energy</li>
							<li>Recovered Energy from Cooling tower, Chiller units, and HPs units</li>
							<li>Cooling Energy to Office Tower Radiant and AHU Systems</li>
							<li>Office and Parking Lighting Energy</li>
							<li>Emergency Lighting and Plugs Energy</li>
							<li>Cold Water Make-up to Cooling Tower, Office Tower and DHWT</li>
							<li>Mechanical Equipment Electrical Energy </li>
							<li>Building Domestic Cold Water and Irrigation Water Consumption</li>
							<li>Heat Recovery Ventilator Wheel Effectiveness</li>
							<li>Outdoor Air Ventilation Volume</li>
							<li>Air Change and Distribution Through VAVs</li>
						</ul>
					</p><br>
					<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that continuously collects instantaneous energy data from this building’s electrical/mechanical/control systems. The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&M and educational purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and calibration of the original design building energy model.
