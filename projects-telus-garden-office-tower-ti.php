					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This project involves the fit-out and construction of new office floors for the TELUS Corporation, which will be located in the newly developed TELUS Garden Office tower, in Vancouver, BC.  The tenant fit-out will take place on nine floors, with a total floor area of approximately 12, 824 m2 (138,000 ft2).  TELUS will occupy all of these 9 floors, which consist of storey’s 2 through 8, and storey’s 21 and 22.

					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Gold project is tasked to provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting (Energy Management Information System - EMIS), as well as verifying energy savings and performance. CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the M&V goals, plans and process for LEED CI 2007 EA Credit 3 for tenant billing, as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&V components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and owner’s goals.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The M&V plan has been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2006 International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are: efficient Jaga Clima Canal heating systems, exemplary performance for water savings, EnergyStar rated appliances, heat source from nearby Telus building, free cooling via central cooling tower, CO2 demand controlled ventilation, building-wide BAS, low-flow water fixtures, raised floor displacement air ventilation system, CES M&V integration with all electrical, mechanical and control systems with instantaneous realtime data, and etc. The M&V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems among other measurement points:
					<ul>
							<li>Total Tenant Space Heating Energy</li>
							<li>Total Tenant Space Mechanical Cooling Energy</li>
							<li>Pump and Fan Energy</li>
							<li>Tenant AHUs Heating Energy</li>
							<li>Tenant Domestic Potable Water Consumption</li>
							<li>Cooling Energy to Office Tower Radiant and AHU Systems</li>
							<li>Heating Energy for Tenants Radiant Slabs</li>
							<li>Make Up Air Unit Energy For Kitchen</li>
							<li>Tenant Lighting Energy </li>
							<li>Tenant Plugs Energy</li>
							<li>Tenant Mech. Energy</li>
							<li>Prorated Energy for Addition from Base Building</li>
							<li>Outdoor Air Ventilation and Exhaust Air Volume for Tenant Space</li>
							<li>Air Change and Distribution Through VAVs</li>
						</ul>
					</p><br>
					<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that continuously collects instantaneous energy data from this building’s electrical/mechanical/control systems. The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&M and educational purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and calibration of the original design building energy model.
