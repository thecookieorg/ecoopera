						This summer, CES Vancouver moved to a great new office space. Located in Burnaby’s Canada Way Business Park, the 5800 square foot open-concept space is constructed to showcase innovations in sustainable technologies.  This office will serve as EcoOpera Systems’ information hub, and as the customer training centre. The latest advancements in the EMIS software (as developed by the EcoOpera R&D group) are continuously on display.
