						The City of Toronto awarded CES with the contract for measuring and validating seasonal efficiencies of four large heating and cooling plants, as a case study for the expansion of the Exhibition Place tri-generation district energy system.  Four large hospitality buildings up to one million square feet each, with chiller plants ranging from 600 to 2000 tons were selected for these projects.  This case study shall determine differences between theoretical “as built” plant seasonal efficiencies, and real life, as operated -seasonal efficiencies.
