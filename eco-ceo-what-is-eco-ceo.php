						EcoCEO (Continuous Energy Optimizer) is a comprehensive Energy Management Information System (EMIS) for supporting and streamlining Energy Monitoring, Targeting and Reporting (MT&R), Measurement and Verification (M&V), Operations and Maintenance (O&M), Commissioning (Cx) and Recommissioning (RCx) and custom processes.  Offered as a web-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or as a turn-key stand-alone system, EcoCEO provides unlimited scalability from stand-alone projects to worldwide building portfolios.
					</p>
					<p>
						The development of EcoCEO was based on industry guidelines, produced through the Canadian and US federal government programs, outlining EMIS performance characteristics and capabilities.<br>
						These guidelines include:
						<ul>
							<li>“Energy Management Information Systems – Achieving Improved Energy Efficiency: A Handbook for Managers, Engineers and Operational Staff”, developed through Natural Resource Canada’s CIPEC (Canadian Industry Program for Energy Conservation);</li>
							<li>“Energy Information Handbook – Applications for Energy-Efficient Building Operations”, published by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and supported through the US Department of Energy’s Building Technologies Program.</li>
						</ul>
						As a result, EcoCEO incorporates and expands upon industry-standard best practices based on comprehensive research.
