					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This will be a new construction office/retails tower project at King George Boulevard, Surrey, B.C, consisting of a 3 levels below grade and 10 storey commercial building with primarily offices and retail units. Total Building Area of 19,251 M2 (207,250 ft2).<br>
						<br>
						The office building includes three underground parkade levels, one level of loading , Commercial Retails (six units including Coast Capital Savings Branch) and lobby, day care and fitness on Level 2, nine floors of office space (L2 to L10 each slightly different as floor plate changes on each floor), lunch room, roof garden and mechanical penthouse located on Level 11.
					</p><br>
					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Gold project is tasked to provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting (Energy Management Information System - EMIS), as well as verifying energy savings and performance. CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the M&V goals, plans and process for LEED EA Credit 5.1 and 5.2, as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&V components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and owner’s goals.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The M&V plan has been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2006 International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are:  heat recovery from district energy, high efficiency VRF controlled chillers, CO2 Demand controlled ventilation, heat recovery ventilators, building-wide BAS, low-flow water fixtures, Double glazing high R value windows, CES M&V integration with all electrical, mechanical and control systems with instantaneous realtime data, low LPD lighting and etc. The M&V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems among other measurement points:
						<ul>
							<li>Total Space Heating Energy</li>
							<li>Total Space Mechanical Cooling Energy</li>
							<li>Pump and Fan Energy</li>
							<li>Office and Parking Lighting Energy</li>
							<li>UPS and Emergency Lighting and Power Energy</li>
							<li>Outdoor Plaza, Car Charging Energy</li>
							<li>Plug Load Electrical Energy Across Building Zones</li>
							<li>Building Domestic Cold Water and Irrigation Water Consumption</li>
							<li>Make-Up Water to Hot Water Heating System</li>
							<li>Heat Recovery Ventilator Wheel Effectiveness</li>
							<li>Total Cooling Efficiency</li>
							<li>Outdoor Air Ventilation Volume</li>
							<li>Air Change and Distribution Through VAVs</li>
						</ul>
					</p><br>
					<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
					<p>CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that continuously collects instantaneous energy data from this building’s electrical/mechanical/control systems. The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&M and educational purposes.<p>
					<p>At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and calibration of the original design building energy model.</p>
