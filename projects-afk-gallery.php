					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This project entails the construction of the new Artist for Kids Gallery and Education Services Centre for the North Vancouver School Board. The new facility constitutes five stories in height with a total floor area of 62,000 Ft2.
					</p><br>
					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Gold project is tasked to provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting (Energy Management Information System - EMIS), as well as verifying energy savings and performance. CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the M&V goals, plans and process for LEED EA Credit 5, as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&V components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and owner’s goals.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The M&V plan has been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2003 International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are:  high efficient central heating and cooling district system, pre-heating of O/A through WWHPs, variable flow displacement ventilation, low temp. radiant slabs, low-flow water fixtures, daylight harvesting, CO2 demand controlled ventilation, CES M&V integration with all electrical, mechanical and control systems with instantaneous realtime data, Occ. Sensors, high efficient lighting and etc. The M&V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems among other measurement points:
						<ul>
							<li>Total Space Heating</li>
							<li>Total Space Cooling</li>
							<li>Pump and Fans Energy</li>
							<li>Humidifier Energy</li>
							<li>Lighting, Plug Loads, UPS and Elevator Energy</li>
							<li>Domestic Water Consumption</li>
							<li>Gained Energy via District System</li>
							<li>Recovered Energy via Heat Recovery Systems</li>
							<li>Outdoor Air Volumes</li>
							<li>Energy Recovery and Gained from four HXs</li>
							<li>Operational Conditions (Occupancy and Weather)</li>
						</ul>
					</p><br>
					<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that continuously collects instantaneous energy data from this building’s electrical/mechanical/control systems. The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&M and educational purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and calibration of the original design building energy model.
