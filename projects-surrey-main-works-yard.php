					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This will be a new construction at the crossroad of 148 Street &amp; 66th Avenue, 
						Surrey BC, with a total Site Area of 75,910 M2. The Project will have occupancy uses for Light Industrial Workshops, 
						Storage / Warehouse, Fleet Automotive Service Garage, and Supporting Offices. 
						The LEED project comprises of two out of three buildings: Admin / Operation Centre and Warehouse with permitted gross floor area of 
						8,855 M2 and 1,290 M2 respectively.
					</p><br>
					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&amp;V) 
						Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Silver project is tasked to 
						provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting 
						(Energy Management Information System - EMIS), 
						as well as verifying energy savings and performance. 
						CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the 
						M&amp;V goals, plans and process for LEED EA Credit 5, as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices 
						requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. 
						During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&amp;V 
						components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and owner’s goals. 
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The M&amp;V plan has been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2006 International 
						Performance Measurement &amp; Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. 
						Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are: 
						high efficiency equipment (Motors, fans, pumps, boilers, DHWHs, etc), HRVs, VFD drives, low flow water fixtures, 
						occupancy and daylight sensors, and building-wide integrated M&amp;V control system and etc. 
						The M&amp;V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems among other measurement points:
					<ul>
						<li>Total Space Heating Energy</li>
						<li>Total Space Mechanical Cooling Energy</li>
						<li>DHW Energy</li>
						<li>Pump and Fan Energy</li>
						<li>Plug Load Electrical Energy Across Office, Critical Process, Workshop and Elevators</li>
						<li>Office, Emergency and Life Safety Lighting Energy</li>
						<li>Mechanical Equipment Electrical Energy</li>
						<li>Building Domestic Cold Water Consumption</li>
						<li>Heat Recovery Core Plate Ventilator and Boiler Effectiveness</li>
						<li>Total Cooling Efficiency</li>
						<li>Outdoor Air Ventilation Volume</li>
						<li>Air Change and Distribution </li>
					</ul>
					</p><br>
					<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that 
						continuously collects instantaneous energy data from this building’s electrical/mechanical/control systems. 
						The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software 
						interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. 
						The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. 
						CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&amp;M and educational purposes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and 
						calibration of the original design building energy model.
