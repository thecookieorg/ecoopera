					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This will be a new construction project consisting of a one storey building to be a Child Care Centre for the Children and Women’s Health Centre of Vancouver, BC. With a building area of 7,400 ft2.
						The Child Care Centre provides a number of day care program uses for up to 49 children including infant, toddler and preschooler program areas within the facility. Main facilities include staff office, bike, cubby, parent observation, kitchen, storage, laundry, WC, and nap rooms.

					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
					CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Gold project is tasked to provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting (Energy Management Information System - EMIS), as well as verifying energy savings and performance. CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the M&V goals, plans and process for LEED EA Credit 5, as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&V components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and owner’s goals.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The M&V plan has been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2006 International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are:  high efficiency boilers and DHWH, heat recovery ventilators, low temp. radiant slabs, building-wide BAS, low-flow water fixtures, VFD fans and pumps, CES M&V integration with all electrical, mechanical and control systems with instantaneous realtime data, high efficient lighting and etc. The M&V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems among other measurement points:
						<ul>
							<li>Total Space Heating Energy</li>
							<li>Total Space Mechanical Cooling Energy</li>
							<li>DHW Gas Consumption</li>
							<li>Pump and Fan Energy</li>
							<li>Interior Lighting, Exterior Lighting,  Emergency Lighting Energy</li>
							<li>Mechanical Equipment Electrical Energy</li>
							<li>Plug Load Electrical Energy Across Building Zones</li>
							<li>Building Heating Load</li>
							<li>Building Domestic Cold Water,  Irrigation Water, Domestic Hot Water Consumption</li>
							<li>Make-Up Water to Hot Water Heating System</li>
							<li>Heat Recovery Ventilator Wheel Effectiveness</li>
							<li>Boiler Efficiency</li>
							<li>Outdoor Air Ventilation Volume</li>
							<li>Air Change and Distribution</li>
						</ul>
						</p><br>
						<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
						<p>
							CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that continuously collects instantaneous energy data from this building’s electrical/mechanical/control systems. The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&M and educational purposes.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and calibration of the original design building energy model.
