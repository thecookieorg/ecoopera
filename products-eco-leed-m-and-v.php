		            EcoLEED-M&amp;V is a more advanced version of the EcoTrack module that allows comparison of actual building performance 
                against theoretical performance derived from a calibrated energy model.
                The use of well-placed sub-meters provides a full breakdown of building consumption by end-use.
                Compare end-use consumption with theoretical optimized consumption from the building design energy model.
                Determine accurate energy and cost savings for new construction projects from exceeding code minimum requirements.<br>
                <br>
                Features include all capabilities of EcoTrack plus:
                <ul>
                  <li>Full building energy, energy-cost and emissions breakdown by end-use – lighting, plug loads, cooling, heating, fans, pumps</li>
                  <li>Statistical benchmark modelling for any energy end-use for tracking end-use performance</li>
                  <li>Real-time end-use comparison with proposed and reference design energy models data</li>
                  <li>Measured energy, cost and emissions savings relative to ASHRAE 90.1 minimum requirements</li>
                </ul>
