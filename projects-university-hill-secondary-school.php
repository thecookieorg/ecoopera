					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This project entails the renovation of an existing 70000 ft2 building, and addition of 56000 ft2 of new construction near University of BC, Vancouver, BC.  Both renovated portion and new construction will be integrated into one to form a new secondary school governed by school district #39. 
						The new facility will be two stories in height, with a gross floor area of approximately 120,000 ft2 which encompasses complete teaching areas and recreational facilities in an advanced education building.
					</p><br>
					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Gold project is tasked to provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting (Energy Management Information System - EMIS), as well as verifying energy savings and performance. CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the M&V goals, plans and process for LEED EA Credit 5, as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&V components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and owner’s goals.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The M&V plan has been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2003 International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are:  warm edge window spacers, variable speed systems, Heat recovery ventilation systems, low-flow water fixtures, daylight harvesting, CO2 demand controlled ventilation with VFD fans, CES M&V integration with all electrical, mechanical and control systems with instantaneous realtime data, improved building envelope and fenestration, high efficient lighting and etc. The M&V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems:
					<ul>
							<li>Total Space Heating</li>
							<li>Total Space Cooling</li>
							<li>Pump and Fans Energy</li>
							<li>Domestic Hot Water Energy</li>
							<li>Process (Laboratories and Food Services) Energy</li>
							<li>Lighting and Plug Loads Energy</li>
							<li>Domestic Water Consumption</li>
							<li>Recovered Energy via Heat Recovery Systems</li>
							<li>Outdoor Air Volumes</li>
							<li>Chiller Efficiency</li>
							<li>Building Cooling Load at the Water to Air Heat Pumps’ Load Side</li>
							<li>Boiler Units Heating Make up to Water to Air Heat Pump Load Side</li>
							<li>Operational Conditions (Occupancy and Weather)</li>
						</ul>
					</p><br>
					<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that continuously collects instantaneous energy data from this building’s electrical/mechanical/control systems. The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&M and educational purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and calibration of the original design building energy model.
