					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This project involves the renovation to an existing 2 storey retail building located at 1025 Robson St, Vancouver. The site currently contains a two storey commercial building housing retail and restaurant uses. This includes reconfiguring most of the existing retail units and filling in the atrium section. The building was designed and constructed as “Core and Shell” and tenant fit-ups would be done after the core completion.
					</p><br>
					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Silver project is tasked to provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting (Energy Management Information System - EMIS), as well as verifying energy savings and performance. CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the M&V goals, plans and process for LEED EA Credit 5.1 and 5.2, as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&V components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and measurement goals.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The base building and Tenants M&V plans have been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2003 International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are: high efficiency gas-fired boiler, Fluid cooler to enhance the heat recovery process, closed loop water-to-air distributed heat pumps, premium electric hot water tank, CES M&V integration with all electrical, mechanical and control systems with instantaneous realtime data, low-flow water fixtures, high efficient lighting and etc. The M&V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems:
					<ul>
							<li>Building Heating load</li>
							<li>Building Cooling load</li>
							<li>Tenants’ individual heating and cooling loads</li>
							<li>Central heating plant gas consumption</li>
							<li>Central heat pump loop pumping power consumption</li>
							<li>Supply and exhaust fans power consumption</li>
							<li>Tenants’ individual Domestic cold water usage</li>
							<li>Building electrical consumption</li>
							<li>Lighting electrical consumption</li>
						</ul>
					</p><br>
					<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that continuously collects instantaneous energy data from the building electrical/mechanical/control systems. The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&M and educational purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and calibration of the original design building energy model.
