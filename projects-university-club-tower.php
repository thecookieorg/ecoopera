					<h4>Building Summary</h4>
					<p>
						This will be a new construction in downtown Vancouver, BC consisting of a 35 storey office building with four levels of parking below grade. Approximate total office and level retails FSR would be 303,000 ft2 on gross site area of 50,436 ft2. 
						The new tower will be used primarily as office space for multiple tenants, with areas on the first three floors for retail services.

					<h4>CES Engagement</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. acting as a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Consultant and Commissioning Authority for this LEED Gold project is tasked to provide customized energy data collection, monitoring and reporting (Energy Management Information System - EMIS), as well as verifying energy savings and performance. CES was involved with the design and engineering team in an integrated design process to architect the M&V goals, plans and process for LEED EA Credit 5 as well as identifying the metering and measurement devices requirements such as BTUs, Air flow, Gas, Water and Electrical meters and zone sensors. During the construction stage CES Engineering has done several site visits and taken care of the M&V components to be installed and complied with the set-out standards and owner’s goals.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Sustainable Features and Monitoring of Energy End-Uses</h4>
					<p>
						The M&V plan has been formulated in consistency with Option D (Whole Building Simulation) of the 2006 International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume III. Some of the sustainable features and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) included in the building to note are:  , high efficiency VRF heating and cooling system, with each floor having its own stand alone system including dedicated condenser units, zone fan coils and BS control boxes;  electrical car receptacles, 100% outdoor air via heat recovery ventilators, building-wide BAS, low-flow water fixtures, raised floor displacement air ventilation system, CES M&V integration with all electrical, mechanical and control systems with instantaneous realtime data, high efficiency lighting fixtures with occupancy sensors and day lighting sensors, and etc. The M&V system monitors the following building systems and sub-systems among other measurement points:
					<ul>
							<li>Total Space Heating Energy</li>
							<li>Total Space Mechanical Cooling Energy</li>
							<li>Pump and Fan Energy</li>
							<li>Floor by Floor Lighting/Plugs and Mechanical Energy</li>
							<li>VRF System Efficiency and Heat Recovery</li>
							<li>Recovered Energy from Cooling tower</li>
							<li>Office and Parking Lighting Energy</li>
							<li>Emergency Lighting, Plugs, and Elevator Energy</li>
							<li>Cold Water Make-up to Cooling Tower, Office Tower and DHWT</li>
							<li>Building Domestic Cold Water and Irrigation Water Consumption</li>
							<li>Heat Recovery Ventilator Wheel Effectiveness</li>
							<li>Outdoor Air Ventilation Volume</li>
							<li>Air Change and Distribution At Floors</li>
						</ul>
					</p><br>
					<h4>Performance Reporting</h4>
					<p>
						CES Engineering Ltd. provides a dedicated EMIS which includes the customized data acquisition system that continuously collects instantaneous energy data from this building’s electrical/mechanical/control systems. The collected information is automatically uploaded to the off-site database server and used on intuitive software interface for reports and summaries of energy consumptions, operation status and plant efficiencies. The 12 month monitoring period post building occupancy was set to be started after stable operation of building systems. CES is issuing periodic systems performances and energy reports to the Facility group for diagnostic, improvement, O&M and educational purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of 12 month monitoring period, a summary report of system functions and energy consumption will be issued for verification and calibration of the original design building energy model.
